- Mount volume in container: `docker run -it -v mydata:/data myimage`

 2. Docker Network

kubernetes

how containers are managed in kubernetes
1.yaml - app

2.kubectl sends requests and kupe-apiserver recieves requests

3.etcd - saves the app config in desired state

4.kube-scheduler -  finds a node

5.controller - ensures pod runs

6.kubelet - start container inside the pod

7.kube-proxy - handles networking

8.kubelet - monitors, controller manager - auto heals


1. Pod 
- Smallest deployable unit in Kubernetes.
- Can contain one or more containers.
- no stable endpoints and fixed ip(replicas)

2. ReplicaSet
- Maintains a stable number of replica Pods.
- Automatically replaces failed or terminated Pods.

3. Deployment
- Manages ReplicaSets.
- Supports rolling updates and rollbacks.

4. Services
- Exposes a group of pods as a stable network endpoint.
- Needed because pod IPs are temporary.
- gives one fixed IP/port to access all pods.
- it load balances traffic to pods automatically. 

 a. ClusterIP
- Default type of service.
- Exposes the service on a cluster-internal IP.

 b. NodePort
- Exposes the service on each Node’s IP at a static port.
- Allows external access to the service.

 c. LoadBalancer
- Provisions an external IP to access the service via a cloud provider’s load balancer.
